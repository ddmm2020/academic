abstract: For 35 years, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
has been the method of choice for modeling complex atomistic phenomena from first principles. However, most AIMD
applications are limited by computational cost to systems with
thousands of atoms at most. We report that a machine learningbased simulation protocol (Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics),
while retaining ab initio accuracy, can simulate more than 1
nanosecond-long trajectory of over 100 million atoms per day,
using a highly optimized code (GPU DeePMD-kit) on the Summit
supercomputer. Our code can efficiently scale up to the entire
Summit supercomputer, attaining 91 PFLOPS in double precision
(45.5% of the peak) and 162/275 PFLOPS in mixed-single/half
precision. The great accomplishment of this work is that it opens
the door to simulating unprecedented size and time scales with ab
initio accuracy. It also poses new challenges to the next-generation
supercomputer for a better integration of machine learning and
physical modeling.
